# match-2-prototype
Unity match-2 (aka blast) game prototype

Cells in the grid can be changed to the target type via "grid controller"(you have to lock "grid controller" and select the cells you want to change in the scene)
Grid can be created dynamically via "grid controller"
Goals can be created dynamically via "goal handler"

Cells may look like match-3 but this is a match-2 project :)
